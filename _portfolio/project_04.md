A numerical framework was developed in this study to investigate the influence of relevant Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM) processing conditions on the final fiber orientation, inter-bead void and cross-sectional geometry of the bead laid down as the extrudate. 

Specifically, four key processes of the EDAM process are studied. The simulations utilize an anisotropic viscous flow model implemented using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method in Abaqus and fiber orientation vectors are evolved under the assumption of affine motion.The Abaqus user material (VUMAT) is from  <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/sor/jor/article/62/6/1443/1001527/Simulation-of-prepreg-platelet-compression-molding">2018 Favaloro et al. </a>

The simulation results are compared with experiments for printed bead geometries produced and this comparison was shown to validate the modeling approach as useful for predicting fiber orientation, bead geometry, and bead-to-bead contact interface geometry.

The processing parameters considered are nozzle height from the substrate, the ratio of the print speed to the extrusion speed (V_b/V_e), and the bead-to-bead lateral overlap distance. A series of virtual experiments were conducted, and the following observations were noted: (i) the bead printed with a high nozzle height has significantly more fiber alignment in the printing direction than the lower nozzle height, (ii) the ratio of the print speed and extrudate speed, V_b/V_e, of greater than unity results in greater fiber alignment than for V_b/V_e<1.
