This project was a part of the Boeing AerosPACE project over the course of the 2017-2018 school year. The project involves design, manufacturing, and testing of the UAS system that was requested for the project by Boeing and the AerosPACE faculty. For the project, the requirements were that the UAS needed to be a hand-launched, fixed-wing UAV that accomplished a mission of the project team’s choosing based upon feedback from key stakeholders that would be affected by the project’s outcome. The UAV was conceived, designed, built, and tested based upon those criteria.

At the end of the course, the UAV was shown to be able to fly autonomously along a preset path and transmit video data back to the user which proves that the system could meet those two requirements. In contrast, the system was only flown a distance of 18.6 miles in testing on a partial battery charge which was extrapolated to show that the UAS would have been able to fly a total of 29.2 miles on a fully charged battery which was less than the 50 mile mission

Finite Element Analysis was conducted to ensure the structural capability of the aluminum U bracket that attaches the fuslage and the tail boom. Experimental test was conducted on the tail boom and wing to ensure that they can widthstand the required loads
