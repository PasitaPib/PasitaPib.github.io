Lyophilization or freeze drying is a process of removing water by sublimation. It is commonly used to extend the 
shelf life of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the process is costly and time consuming, precise and 
efficient pressure, temperature control and drying time estimation are required. It is the goal of freeze-drying to 
run at maximum capacity while staying within the safe zone by carefully controlling the sublimation rate. 
Currently, real time estimation of sublimation rate is still challenging. The technique available called Tunable 
diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) is invasive, and requires major modifications. The current study 
focuses on exploring a new method of measuring the sublimation rate by using Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) and pressure sensors currently used. This involves both numerical analysis, using ANSYS FLUENT, and 
experiment of ice sublimation to find sublimation rate as a function of pressure drop across the pipe connecting 
the chamber and the condenser. The experiments were set up by increasing the shelf temperature in steps at 
certain pressure set points, and then the condenser pressure and sublimation rate were recorded. Using 
condenser pressure and chamber pressure as inputs for flow simulations, verification was done by comparing 
the simulated and experimental sublimation rates. The sublimation rates and pressure drops showed a positive 
nonlinear correlation, which was also dependent on the geometry of the freeze dryer. Each freeze dryer has 
different duct lengths and diameters. These parameters should be further investigated and included in the 
sublimation rate estimation in the future.
