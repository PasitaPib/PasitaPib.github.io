Anisotropy caused by flow-induced fiber orientation of discontinuous fibers within the extrudate in the Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM) process gives rise to anisotropic shrinkage in printed parts and thereby, final part deformations. <br>

Two fiber properties, isotropic glass fiber (GF) and transversely isotropic carbon fiber (CF) along with three fiber orientation tensors (OT) were investigated, resulting in six combinations. OT 1 has the most randomly oriented fiber, and OT 3 is the most collimated fiber system. <br>

The geometry has kinematic boundary condition on the nodes of the bottom surface keeping the bottom surface fixed to the bed for the entire printing process. Then, the printed geometry cooled down on heated print bed for 6 minutes. Afterwards, it was taken off the bed and the kinematic boundary condition was release and let it cool down to room temperature. <br>

A curvilinear geometry named "UU shape" was modeled and printed virtually in the thermo-mechanical simulation, ADDITIVE3DÂ©. The geometry contained three half circle regions and straight lines to introduce significant magnification of the spring-in deformation. The color bar in the gif below is the deformation in the y-direction.<br>

The predicted deformation of the printed geometry for the three fiber orientation states and two material systems were compared. The deformation predicted for glass fiber-filled polyamide and carbon fiber-filled polyamide of the same fiber orientation states showed comparable deformations. The largest residual deformation was shown to correspond to the orientation tensor with the greatest degree of anisotropy. <br>
