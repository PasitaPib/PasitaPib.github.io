DuPont, Local Motors, and the Composites Manufacturing and Simulation Center (CMSC) at Purdue worked together to advance process simulation capabilities for Additive Manufacturing (AM) and develop printable short fiber reinforced semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastics suitable for vehicle components. DuPont provided one candidate thermoplastic material, which was evaluated against the following three criteria: 1 Printability using extrusion additive manufacturing processes. 2 Suitability for vehicle applications based on mechanical coupon screening tests. 3 Predictive capability of process simulations. Indiana Manufacturing Institute provided modeling and simulation technology and access to Purdue’s lab scale AM printer. Local Motors provided mechanical property requirements and printed demonstration prototype components using their Thermwood Large Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM) printer. To meet the performance and cost requirements of the automotive industry, high fiber content semi-crystalline engineering materials are required. Printing experience and property data for a 50% by weight short glass fiber reinforced material were gathered. Further, material properties required for simulating the printing process with the glass-fiber reinforced material were characterized. Knowledge was acquired with regards to the processability and performance of this thermoplastic material. Predictions of part deformation and crystallinity level were verified against experimental observations. Any significant results other than verification of simulation, e.g., novel material
