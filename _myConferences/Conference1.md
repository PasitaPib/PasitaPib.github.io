Successful extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) production critically depends on the understanding of the process-structure-property relationship. Especially on the fracture properties to prevent premature mechanical failure. The intra-bead fracture is governed by the fusion bonding between the adjacent printed beads which is influenced by the temperature history which is greatly dependent on printing parameters. A two steps workflow was developed to investigate the relationship between the printing conditions and temperature history.

First, a numerical framework utilizing smoothed particle hydrodynamics was developed to investigate the influence of processing conditions on the bead’s final fiber orientation, cross-sectional geometry, and inter-bead void. The processing parameters considered are layer height and bead-to-bead spacing.

Second, utilizing the bead dimension and average fiber orientation across the bead from step 1, temperature history was predicted using a heat transfer simulation in Abaqus. The processing parameter considered is the print layer time. The bead dimension and temperature history prediction were validated with printing experiments. Utilizing the developed workflow, one bead layer height was investigated with three bead-to-bead spacing and two print layer times. The layer time was found to have a great influence on the temperature history and bead overlap has minimal effect on temperature history.
